    "Login returns both access_token (296 chars) and refresh_token (297 chars)",

    "Logout revokes refresh token - 401 on subsequent refresh attempts",
    "JWT tokens contain org_id and is_super_admin claims correctly",

    "Lab JWT: org_id='ORG-LAB-2024-001', is_super_admin=false",
    "Org isolation unaffected - lab user sees only their data",
    "Frontend login flow working with lab/lab and admin/admin credentials",
    "Frontend stores JWT tokens in localStorage correctly",
    "Frontend API calls include Authorization Bearer header",
    "Screening endpoint accessible from frontend with JWT authentication",

    "All regression tests passed: health endpoints, analytics, PDF upload, org mapping",
    "Mocked API /api/lis/parse-pdf still functional",
    "Backend API latency optimal (45ms)",
    "All authentication and authorization flows preserved from previous milestones"
